# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — V1 in progress
### Added
- Design gate (2026-06-23): `SPEC.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, adversarial `GAP-REVIEW.md` — **gate-clean for V1**.
- Project scaffold: README, MIT LICENSE, .gitignore, this changelog.
- Runnable shell (`index.html`): qualification-path home, accessible dark theme, settings
  (reduced-motion, dyslexia font, text size, read-aloud, high contrast), local profile skeleton.
- **Shared core** as ES modules: `core/sr.js` (SM-2-lite spaced repetition) + `core/store.js`
  (profile, content loader, mastery, gradable-only filter).
- **Content library**: `data/definitions.json` — 63 CROR definitions migrated verbatim from the
  old CROR Quiz, character-for-character verified, cited + `trust:"verified"`.
- **Reference station** (`stations/reference.js`): search, plain-language first, rule text one tap
  deeper, trust badge + citation.
- **Drill station** (`stations/drill.js`): adaptive MC (term↔definition), SM-2 scheduling, citation
  on every answer, mastery feeds the path. F1 enforced — only verified items are graded.
- `app.js`: modular shell with hash routing (home / reference / drill) + settings.
- Verified end-to-end on preview (home, search→detail→verbatim, answer→grade→mastery persist).
- **Signals domain live**: `stations/signal-render.js` (the verified `drawSignal` SVG renderer,
  copied verbatim) + `data/signals.json` (42 indications — 38 verified, 4 needs-review/reference-only).
  Reference renders the aspect variants; Drill is now type-aware (definitions → term↔def, signals →
  read-the-aspect) over one profile; plus a signals-only "🚦 Signals" station.
- **Tip jar**: Ko-fi link (ko-fi.com/jordandoerksen) wired into the footer.
- **Rules / operating content live**: `data/rules.json` (100 cited rule concepts) +
  `data/rule-questions.json` (226 authored MC, verbatim from the old CROR Quiz BANK; answer∈choices
  verified on all). A third drill type (authored operating-rule MC). The remaining domains go live —
  switching, securement, radio, authority, and a new **Operating** bucket — so all 7 light up.
  Live domain cards are now one-tap drills (`#/drill/<domain>`).

### Next
- The Yard (port the switch-list engine); the Radio call walkthrough; the Exam station.
- PWA/offline (service worker + manifest); profile export/import.
